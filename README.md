## Description:
Are you a Pokémon Master? Released in 1996, Pokémon Blue and Red changed the gaming world. The First Generation contained 151 Pokémon that could be combined to create a Team! Comprised of six unique Pokémon, Pokémon Masters could utilize them to battle other Masters or even Gym Leaders! Making a superior team is vital for Victory, and that's where Poke-App comes in.

Poke-App allows any Pokémon Master to create their own Dream Team from the First Generation's 151 Pokémon.
